Consider the following schema for a Library Database:
BOOK(Book_id, Title, Publisher_Name, Pub_Year)
BOOK_AUTHORS(Book_id, Author_Name)
PUBLISHER(Name, Address, Phone)
BOOK_COPIES(Book_id, Branch_id, No-of_Copies)
BOOK_LENDING(Book_id, Branch_id, Card_No, Date_Out, Due_Date)
LIBRARY_BRANCH(Branch_id, Branch_Name, Address)
Write SQL queries to
1. Retrieve details of all books in the library – id, title, name of publisher,
authors, number of copies in each branch, etc.
2. Get the particulars of borrowers who have borrowed more than 3 books, but
from Jan 2017 to Jun 2017.
3. Delete a book in BOOK table. Update the contents of other tables to reflect
this data manipulation operation.
4. Partition the BOOK table based on year of publication. Demonstrate its
working with a simple query.
5. Create a view of all books and its number of copies that are currently
available in the Library.


create table publisher
(
 name varchar(30),
 address varchar(30) not null,
 phone varchar(12),
 primary key(name)
);

create table book
(
 bookid int not null,

);

create table authors
(

);

create table branch
(

);

create table borrower

 foreign key(bookid) references book(bookid) on delete cascade,
 foreign key(branchid) references branch(branchid) on delete cascade,
 foreign key(cardno) references borrower(cardno) on delete cascade
);

create table bookcopies
(
